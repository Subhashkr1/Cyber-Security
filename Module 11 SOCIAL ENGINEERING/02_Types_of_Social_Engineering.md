# Types of Social Engineering

Social engineering attacks come in various forms, each designed to exploit human vulnerabilities in unique ways. Below are some of the most common types of social engineering:

---

## 1. **Phishing**
Phishing involves sending deceptive emails, messages, or websites that appear legitimate to trick victims into revealing sensitive information like login credentials or financial details.

### Example:
- A fake email from a bank asking you to verify your account details.

### Subtypes:
- **Spear Phishing**: Highly targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals or organizations.
- **Whaling**: Phishing targeting high-profile individuals like executives (CEOs, CFOs).
- **Smishing**: Phishing via SMS messages.
- **Pharming**: Redirecting users to fraudulent websites, even if the URL is typed correctly.

---

## 2. **Pretexting**
Pretexting involves creating a fabricated scenario (or pretext) to gain the victim's trust and extract sensitive information. This type often impersonates authority figures or trusted entities.

### Example:
- A scammer posing as an IT support technician requesting login credentials to "fix" a problem.

---

## 3. **Baiting**
Baiting uses a lure—such as free downloads, prizes, or physical items like USB drives—to entice victims into performing an action that compromises security.

### Example:
- A USB drive labeled "Confidential Salary Information" left in a public place, designed to tempt someone to plug it into their computer.

---

## 4. **Quid Pro Quo**
Quid Pro Quo offers something in exchange for information or access. Attackers may promise technical support, rewards, or benefits in return for cooperation.

### Example:
- A fake caller claiming to be from tech support, offering to fix a problem in exchange for system credentials.

---

## 5. **Tailgating (or Piggybacking)**
Tailgating occurs when an unauthorized person gains physical access to a restricted area by following an authorized individual closely.

### Example:
- An attacker pretending to carry heavy boxes, asking someone to hold the door open to a secure area.

---

## 6. **Vishing (Voice Phishing)**
Vishing involves extracting sensitive information through phone calls. The attacker often impersonates a trusted entity like a bank, government agency, or technical support.

### Example:
- A scam call claiming suspicious activity on your credit card and requesting verification details.

---

## 7. **Watering Hole Attacks**
Attackers compromise a specific website or online resource commonly visited by the target group. Visitors to the site are then infected with malware.

### Example:
- Infecting a website frequently used by employees of a specific company.

---

## 8. **Shoulder Surfing**
This involves observing someone’s private information by looking over their shoulder, such as when entering passwords or PINs.

### Example:
- Watching someone type their ATM PIN in public.

---

## 9. **Dumpster Diving**
Dumpster diving involves searching through discarded materials (like trash) to find sensitive information such as shredded documents, receipts, or device logs.

### Example:
- Finding an employee’s discarded ID badge in a company’s dumpster.
