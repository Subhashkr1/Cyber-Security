# Human-Based Social Engineering

Human-based social engineering involves manipulating individuals directly through psychological tactics to gain access to sensitive information, systems, or resources. Unlike technical methods, this approach focuses entirely on exploiting human behavior and trust.

## Characteristics of Human-Based Social Engineering
- **Interpersonal Interaction**: Relies on direct communication, whether in person, over the phone, or through other mediums.
- **Trust Exploitation**: Takes advantage of individuals' willingness to help or comply with authority.
- **No Technical Skills Required**: Involves psychological manipulation rather than technical hacking.

## Common Human-Based Social Engineering Techniques

### 1. **Impersonation**
The attacker pretends to be someone the victim trusts, such as a coworker, IT support, or a government official, to gain information or access.

#### Example:
- Posing as a company technician asking for login credentials to "fix" an issue.

---

### 2. **Tailgating (Piggybacking)**
The attacker physically follows an authorized person into a restricted area by taking advantage of their politeness or lack of vigilance.

#### Example:
- Pretending to have forgotten an access card and asking someone to hold the door.

---

### 3. **Shoulder Surfing**
The attacker observes sensitive information, such as PINs, passwords, or private documents, by looking over the victim's shoulder.

#### Example:
- Watching someone type their ATM PIN in a crowded location.

---

### 4. **Third-Party Authorization**
The attacker manipulates one person to convince another to grant access or share information.

#### Example:
- Calling a junior employee, pretending to be a senior executive, and instructing them to share confidential files.

---

### 5. **Reverse Social Engineering**
The attacker creates a problem (real or fabricated) and then offers assistance as the "solution provider." This builds trust and allows the attacker to extract valuable information.

#### Example:
- Disabling a network connection and posing as IT support to "resolve" the issue.

---

### 6. **Eavesdropping**
Listening in on private conversations to gather information without direct interaction.

#### Example:
- Sitting near a group discussing confidential business plans in a public space.

## How to Prevent Human-Based Social Engineering
1. **Training and Awareness**: Regularly educate employees on common tactics and red flags.
2. **Verify Identities**: Always confirm the identity and authority of individuals making requests.
3. **Access Control**: Implement strict physical and digital access policies.
4. **Shred Sensitive Documents**: Prevent dumpster diving by securely disposing of confidential materials.
5. **Monitor Social Engineering Attempts**: Report and track incidents to identify recurring patterns.

Human-based social engineering preys on trust, curiosity, and human error. Vigilance and proactive measures can significantly reduce the risk of such attacks.
