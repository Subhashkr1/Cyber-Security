What is MAC Spoofing?
MAC Spoofing is a technique used by attackers to change the Media Access Control (MAC) address of a device's network interface card (NIC) to impersonate another device on the same network. A MAC address is a unique identifier assigned to NICs and is used for communication within a network.

How MAC Spoofing Works
Network Environment: The attacker identifies a target device's MAC address on the network using tools like ARP requests or sniffing tools.
Changing MAC Address:
The attacker configures their NIC to use the target's MAC address by altering their system settings or using specialized tools.
Packet Redirection:
The attacker uses the spoofed MAC address to intercept, redirect, or manipulate network traffic.
Motivations Behind MAC Spoofing
Bypass Network Restrictions:
Spoofing can allow unauthorized devices to access restricted networks, e.g., networks filtered by MAC addresses.
Impersonation:
An attacker can impersonate another device to gain trust or perform malicious activities.
MITM Attacks:
MAC spoofing is often a precursor to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, enabling attackers to intercept sensitive data.
Anonymity:
Changing the MAC address helps attackers hide their real device identity.
Evade Detection:
Spoofing helps bypass network monitoring systems or evade being blacklisted.
Steps to Perform MAC Spoofing
1. Identify the Target MAC Address:
Use sniffing tools like:
Wireshark: To monitor ARP requests/responses.
arp-scan: To find active devices on the network.
2. Change the MAC Address:
On Linux:

bash
Copy code
ifconfig eth0 down
ifconfig eth0 hw ether XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
ifconfig eth0 up
On Windows:

Go to Device Manager > Network Adapter > Properties.
In the Advanced Tab, find Network Address or Locally Administered Address and set the desired MAC address.
Using Tools:

macchanger (Linux).
Technitium MAC Address Changer (Windows).
Types of Attacks Enabled by MAC Spoofing
Session Hijacking:
An attacker impersonates a legitimate user to take over their session.
ARP Spoofing:
MAC spoofing is used to manipulate ARP tables, redirecting traffic to the attacker's device.
Denial of Service (DoS):
Spoofing the MAC address of a critical device can disrupt its normal communication.
Bypassing MAC Filtering:
Spoofing allows unauthorized devices to join networks that filter access based on MAC addresses.
Tools for MAC Spoofing
macchanger:
A popular Linux tool to manipulate MAC addresses.
SMAC:
A Windows-based tool for MAC spoofing.
Technitium MAC Address Changer:
User-friendly Windows application.
Ettercap:
A tool that supports ARP spoofing and MAC manipulation.
Defenses Against MAC Spoofing
Port Security:

Configure switches to allow only specific MAC addresses on each port.
Set a limit on the number of MAC addresses per port.
Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI):

Validates ARP packets and ensures the MAC address matches the IP address.
802.1X Authentication:

Use network-level authentication protocols to restrict device access.
Static ARP Entries:

Configure ARP entries for critical devices to prevent manipulation.
Monitor Network Traffic:

Use tools like Wireshark to detect duplicate MAC addresses or abnormal ARP activity.
Enable Logging and Alerts:

Configure IDS/IPS to flag suspicious MAC address changes or ARP anomalies.
