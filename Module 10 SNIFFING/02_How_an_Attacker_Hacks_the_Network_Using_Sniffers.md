An attacker can use sniffers to hack a network by capturing, analyzing, and exploiting data packets being transmitted over the network. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how this is typically done:

1. Reconnaissance and Network Scanning
Before deploying sniffers, attackers perform reconnaissance to gather information about the network, such as:

Network topology: Identifying the type of network (wired/wireless, hub/switch).
IP and MAC addresses: Mapping devices on the network.
Open ports and services: Detecting vulnerabilities in running services.
Tools Used:
Nmap: To scan and map networks.
Angry IP Scanner: To find active devices and their details.
2. Choosing the Sniffing Technique
The attacker decides the appropriate sniffing method based on the network type:

Passive Sniffing:
Works on non-switched networks (like hubs).
Data packets are broadcasted to all devices, allowing easy capture.
Active Sniffing:
Required for switched networks, where data is sent only to intended recipients.
Common active techniques include:
ARP Spoofing/Poisoning: Associating the attacker’s MAC address with the IP of the target device.
MAC Flooding: Overloading the switch’s MAC table, forcing it into hub mode.
DNS Spoofing: Redirecting users to malicious sites.
3. Capturing Data Packets
The attacker sets up the sniffer to capture packets traveling over the network. This step includes:

Capturing all traffic on the network or targeting specific devices.
Filtering sensitive information such as:
Login credentials.
Session tokens.
Financial data.
Tools Used:
Wireshark: Captures and analyzes packets.
tcpdump: Command-line packet capturing.
Ettercap: For active sniffing and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
4. Decoding and Analyzing Data
Captured packets are decoded to extract useful information:

Plain-text information: Extracted directly (e.g., HTTP credentials).
Encrypted data: Attackers may try to decrypt it using brute force or dictionary attacks.
Tools Used:
Cain and Abel: Password recovery and packet decryption.
John the Ripper: Cracking encrypted data.
5. Exploitation
Once the attacker obtains sensitive information, they can exploit it in various ways:

Stealing credentials: Gaining unauthorized access to systems or services.
Session hijacking: Using session tokens to impersonate users.
Data theft: Extracting confidential data for malicious purposes.
Injecting malicious content: Redirecting users to phishing or malware-infected websites.
Example Scenarios
Scenario 1: Capturing Credentials on Public Wi-Fi
The attacker sets up a sniffer on a public Wi-Fi network.
They capture unencrypted data packets (e.g., HTTP traffic).
Extract usernames, passwords, and personal details.
Scenario 2: Man-in-the-Middle Attack
The attacker uses ARP spoofing to position themselves between the victim and the router.
Captures all traffic between the victim and the internet.
Monitors sensitive data or injects malicious packets.
6. Evading Detection
To avoid being caught, attackers may:

Use encrypted communication (e.g., VPN or TOR) to hide their activity.
Delete logs and traces after the attack.
Use anti-detection tools to bypass security mechanisms.
Defensive Measures
To protect against sniffing attacks, implement the following:

Use HTTPS for secure browsing.
Encrypt sensitive communications with VPNs or TLS.
Employ anti-sniffing tools to detect sniffing activity.
Configure network switches with port security and ARP inspection.
Regularly monitor network traffic for anomalies.
