What is Sniffing?
Sniffing is a cybersecurity term that refers to the act of intercepting and monitoring data packets traveling over a network. This process allows an individual, known as a sniffer, to capture and analyze the information being transmitted between devices.

Sniffing can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes:

Legitimate Use Cases
Network Troubleshooting: Network administrators use sniffing tools to monitor and diagnose network issues.
Performance Monitoring: Ensuring optimal network performance by analyzing data flow and detecting bottlenecks.
Debugging Protocols: Identifying and fixing issues in network protocols.
Malicious Use Cases
Data Theft: Intercepting sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details.
Session Hijacking: Capturing session cookies to impersonate users and take over their sessions.
Eavesdropping: Monitoring private communications without authorization.
Types of Sniffing
Passive Sniffing

Monitors data on a network without altering or affecting it.
Typically used on non-switched networks (e.g., hubs).
Example: Capturing unencrypted data like plain-text passwords.
Active Sniffing

Involves injecting traffic or manipulating the network to capture more data.
Commonly used on switched networks.
Example: ARP spoofing to intercept packets.
Common Sniffing Techniques
MAC Flooding: Overloading a network switch to force it into a hub-like state, allowing all data to be captured.
ARP Spoofing: Sending fake ARP messages to associate the attacker’s MAC address with another device’s IP.
DNS Spoofing: Redirecting DNS queries to malicious websites.
Packet Injection: Introducing malicious packets into the network to manipulate traffic.
Tools Used for Sniffing
Wireshark: A popular network protocol analyzer for legitimate uses.
tcpdump: A command-line packet analyzer.
Cain and Abel: Often used for ARP spoofing and password recovery.
Ettercap: A comprehensive suite for man-in-the-middle attacks.
Preventive Measures Against Sniffing
Encryption:
Use encrypted communication protocols like HTTPS, TLS, and VPNs.
Network Segmentation:
Isolate sensitive parts of the network.
Anti-Sniffing Tools:
Tools that detect sniffing activities in a network.
Use of Switched Networks:
Avoid hubs and use network switches to limit data access.
Strong Authentication:
Implement secure authentication mechanisms like 2FA.
Monitoring:
Regularly audit and monitor network traffic for unusual activity.
