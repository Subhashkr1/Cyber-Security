Several protocols are inherently vulnerable to sniffing because they transmit data in plaintext or lack robust encryption and authentication mechanisms. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to capture sensitive information, such as credentials or private communications. Below is a list of commonly sniffed protocols:

1. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
Vulnerability: Transmits data in plaintext, making it easy to intercept and read.
Risk: Attackers can capture:
Login credentials.
Cookies and session tokens.
Sensitive data in forms or URLs.
Mitigation: Use HTTPS, which encrypts data using TLS.
2. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Vulnerability: Sends usernames and passwords in plaintext during authentication.
Risk: Attackers can:
Steal credentials.
Intercept file transfers containing sensitive information.
Mitigation: Use SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP Secure).
3. Telnet
Vulnerability: Plaintext transmission of commands, credentials, and session data.
Risk: Attackers can:
Capture administrator credentials.
Intercept commands to manipulate systems.
Mitigation: Use SSH (Secure Shell) for encrypted communication.
4. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), POP3, and IMAP
Vulnerability: These email protocols often transmit credentials and messages in plaintext.
Risk: Attackers can:
Steal email login credentials.
Read sensitive emails.
Mitigation: Use secure versions like SMTP with STARTTLS, POP3S, or IMAPS.
5. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
Vulnerability: Older versions (SNMP v1 and v2) transmit data, including community strings (passwords), in plaintext.
Risk: Attackers can:
Monitor network devices.
Modify device configurations.
Mitigation: Use SNMP v3, which supports encryption and authentication.
6. DNS (Domain Name System)
Vulnerability: DNS queries are sent in plaintext, making them susceptible to sniffing and spoofing.
Risk: Attackers can:
Redirect users to malicious websites.
Gather domain-related information for reconnaissance.
Mitigation: Use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT).
7. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
Vulnerability: Older versions may lack strong encryption or rely on weak configurations.
Risk: Attackers can:
Capture session data.
Intercept credentials.
Mitigation: Use updated versions of RDP with strong encryption and Network Level Authentication (NLA).
8. VoIP Protocols (e.g., SIP, RTP)
Vulnerability: Voice data transmitted over RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) can be intercepted.
Risk: Attackers can:
Capture voice calls (eavesdropping).
Manipulate call data.
Mitigation: Use SRTP (Secure RTP) for encrypted communication.
9. SMB (Server Message Block)
Vulnerability: Older versions (e.g., SMB v1) transmit data without proper encryption.
Risk: Attackers can:
Intercept file-sharing data.
Exploit known vulnerabilities.
Mitigation: Use SMB v3 with encryption enabled.
10. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
Vulnerability: ARP lacks authentication, making it susceptible to spoofing and sniffing.
Risk: Attackers can:
Perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
Redirect traffic through their system.
Mitigation: Use Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) and configure static ARP entries for critical systems.
11. TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
Vulnerability: Transmits data and files in plaintext without authentication.
Risk: Attackers can:
Intercept sensitive configurations.
Manipulate transferred files.
Mitigation: Avoid TFTP; use secure alternatives like SFTP or FTPS.
12. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
Vulnerability: ICMP packets can be sniffed to gather information about the network topology.
Risk: Attackers can:
Identify active hosts.
Conduct reconnaissance for further attacks.
Mitigation: Limit ICMP traffic using firewall rules.
13. NTP (Network Time Protocol)
Vulnerability: Transmits data in plaintext, making it susceptible to sniffing and spoofing.
Risk: Attackers can:
Manipulate timestamps.
Launch DDoS amplification attacks.
Mitigation: Use NTP with authentication and limit access to trusted sources.
Summary
Protocols vulnerable to sniffing are often legacy or unencrypted protocols, making them easy targets for attackers. Transitioning to secure, encrypted versions (e.g., HTTPS, SSH, SFTP) is essential for mitigating these risks. Additionally, implementing network security measures like firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and encryption can significantly reduce vulnerabilities.
