# Types of Scans in Network Scanning

Network scanning is a critical process in cybersecurity to identify open ports, services, vulnerabilities, and active devices. Below are the various types of scans used:

---

## 1. **Port Scanning**
Identifies open ports and the services running on them. Common methods include:

### a. **TCP Scanning**
- **Full Connect Scan (TCP Connect)**:
  - Completes the three-way handshake.
  - Reliable but easily detected.
  - Example: `nmap -sT`

- **SYN Scan (Half-Open Scan)**:
  - Sends SYN packets without completing the handshake.
  - Stealthier and faster.
  - Example: `nmap -sS`

- **ACK Scan**:
  - Checks if ports are filtered or unfiltered.
  - Example: `nmap -sA`

### b. **UDP Scanning**
- Sends UDP packets to identify open ports.
- Slower than TCP scans.
- Example: `nmap -sU`

---

## 2. **Vulnerability Scanning**
Identifies known vulnerabilities in network services or applications.  
- Tools: Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys.

---

## 3. **Service Version Scanning**
Detects the software version and services running on open ports.  
- Example: `nmap -sV`

---

## 4. **Operating System (OS) Scanning**
Identifies the target's operating system based on packet responses.  
- Example: `nmap -O`

---

## 5. **Network Topology Scanning**
Maps the network to identify devices, their connections, and layout.  
- Tools: SolarWinds, Zenmap.

---

## 6. **Ping Scanning**
Checks active hosts in a network using ICMP requests.  
- Example: `nmap -sn`

---

## 7. **Stealth Scanning**
Avoids detection by firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS).  
### a. **FIN Scan**:
- Sends FIN packets without initiating a handshake.
- Example: `nmap -sF`

### b. **Xmas Scan**:
- Sends packets with FIN, PSH, and URG flags set.
- Example: `nmap -sX`

### c. **Null Scan**:
- Sends packets with no flags set.
- Example: `nmap -sN`

---

## 8. **Application Layer Scanning**
Analyzes specific applications running on the network.  
- Tools: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP.

---

## 9. **Wireless Scanning**
Identifies wireless networks and vulnerabilities, such as weak encryption or rogue access points.  
- Tools: Aircrack-ng, Kismet.

---

## 10. **SNMP Scanning**
Queries devices for configuration and performance data using the SNMP protocol.  
- Example Tool: SNMPwalk.

---

## 11. **IPv6 Scanning**
Scans IPv6 networks, which are less frequently monitored and may have unique vulnerabilities.  
- Example: `nmap -6`

---

## 12. **IDS/Firewall Evasion Scans**
Attempts to bypass detection by security systems.  
- **Fragmentation Scan**: Breaks packets into smaller fragments.
- **Decoy Scan**: Spoofs multiple source IPs.
- Example: `nmap -f` (Fragmentation), `nmap -D RND:10` (Decoy)

---

## 13. **Banner Grabbing**
Collects information from service banners to identify the application and version running on a port.  
- Example: `telnet <IP> <PORT>`

---

## 14. **Compliance Scanning**
Ensures network configurations meet regulatory or security compliance standards.  
- Tools: Nessus, Qualys.

---

## 15. **Web Application Scanning**
Focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in web applications, such as SQL injection or XSS.  
- Tools: Nikto, Burp Suite.

---

## 16. **Cloud Network Scanning**
Targets cloud environments to identify misconfigurations or exposed services.  
- Tools: ScoutSuite, Prowler.

---

## Conclusion
Each scanning type serves a specific purpose and provides insights into network security. The choice of scan depends on the goal, such as detecting vulnerabilities, identifying active hosts, or bypassing security measures.
