# Network Scanning Using Metasploit

Network scanning is a crucial step in identifying vulnerabilities and potential entry points within a network. Metasploit, a powerful penetration testing framework, provides several tools and techniques for scanning and identifying vulnerabilities in a network.

## Prerequisites
Before conducting network scanning using Metasploit, ensure the following:

1. **Metasploit Installation**: Metasploit Framework should be installed on your system. You can install it using the following commands:
   - On Kali Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install metasploit-framework
     ```

   - On Windows, you can download the installer from the [Metasploit official website](https://www.metasploit.com/).

2. **Network Configuration**: Ensure that your target network is accessible, and you have the proper permissions to scan it.

## Scanning a Network with Metasploit

Metasploit has several modules for network scanning. The most commonly used ones include:

### 1. **Basic Network Scanning with `db_nmap`**
   Metasploit comes with a built-in `db_nmap` command, which is essentially an Nmap wrapper that allows integration with the Metasploit database. It helps to save scan results for further exploitation.

   - Syntax:
     ```bash
     db_nmap [options] [target]
     ```

   - Example:
     ```bash
     db_nmap -sS -p 1-65535 192.168.1.0/24
     ```

     - `-sS`: SYN scan (stealth scan).
     - `-p 1-65535`: Scan all ports.
     - `192.168.1.0/24`: The target network range.

   After running the scan, the results will be saved to the Metasploit database for further analysis.

### 2. **Service Version Scanning**
   To gather detailed information about the services running on a target, use version scanning techniques. The `version` module helps identify the versions of services, which can then be checked for known vulnerabilities.

   - Example:
     ```bash
     db_nmap -sV 192.168.1.0/24
     ```

     - `-sV`: Version scan to detect the service version.

### 3. **Operating System Detection**
   Metasploit can also perform OS detection using Nmap options. This helps identify the operating system running on the target machines, which is valuable in vulnerability assessment.

   - Example:
     ```bash
     db_nmap -O 192.168.1.0/24
     ```

     - `-O`: Enable OS detection.

### 4. **Vulnerability Scanning with Metasploit Modules**
   After scanning the network, you can use Metasploit modules to identify vulnerabilities.

   - Example:
     ```bash
     search type:auxiliary scanner
     ```

     This will list various scanners available in Metasploit. Select one based on the service you are targeting.

   For example, to scan for SMB vulnerabilities, you can use the `scanner/smb/smb_version` module.

   - Example:
     ```bash
     use scanner/smb/smb_version
     set RHOSTS 192.168.1.0/24
     run
     ```

## Best Practices for Network Scanning

1. **Permission**: Always get proper authorization before scanning any network. Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.

2. **Scan During Off-Peak Hours**: Network scanning can put a strain on the target systems, so itâ€™s best to conduct scans during off-peak hours to minimize disruption.

3. **Target Specific Hosts**: Rather than scanning an entire network, target specific hosts to reduce the risk of detection and minimize impact.

4. **Use Stealth Techniques**: Employ stealth scanning techniques to avoid detection by Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).

## Conclusion

Metasploit offers a powerful suite of tools for network scanning, including integration with Nmap for detailed service and OS detection. It's an essential tool for penetration testers and ethical hackers. Always ensure you have proper authorization and take necessary precautions to avoid disruptions during scans.
