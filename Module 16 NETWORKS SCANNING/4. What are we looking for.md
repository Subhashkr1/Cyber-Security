# What Are We Looking for in Network Scanning?

Network scanning aims to gather critical information about a network's security, identify vulnerabilities, and map its structure. Below is a detailed breakdown of what we are typically looking for during a network scan:

---

## 1. **Active Hosts**
- Devices currently active on the network.
- IP addresses and MAC addresses of connected devices.
- Identification of unauthorized or rogue devices.

---

## 2. **Open Ports**
- Detection of open network ports on devices.
- Helps identify services running on those ports.
- Unprotected or unnecessary open ports that could be exploited.

---

## 3. **Services Running**
- Applications or services associated with open ports (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH).
- Service versions to identify outdated or vulnerable software.
- Misconfigured or unnecessary services.

---

## 4. **Vulnerabilities**
- Known vulnerabilities in running software or services.
- Weak configurations such as default credentials or missing patches.
- Potential exploits like CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

---

## 5. **Network Topology**
- The structure of the network (e.g., subnets, routers, and switches).
- Relationships and communication paths between devices.
- Detection of bottlenecks or single points of failure.

---

## 6. **Operating Systems**
- Identification of operating system types and versions on devices.
- Outdated or unsupported operating systems that may pose risks.

---

## 7. **Security Configurations**
- Presence of firewalls, intrusion detection, or prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
- Encryption protocols in use (e.g., SSL/TLS versions).
- Weak authentication methods such as plaintext passwords.

---

## 8. **Wireless Networks**
- Detection of wireless networks (SSID, encryption type, signal strength).
- Weak encryption protocols (e.g., WEP or open networks).
- Rogue access points or unauthorized wireless devices.

---

## 9. **User Accounts and Credentials**
- Weak or default credentials on devices or services.
- Shared accounts or improper privilege management.

---

## 10. **Misconfigurations**
- Open shares or exposed directories.
- Misconfigured DNS, DHCP, or other critical services.
- Publicly accessible administrative interfaces.

---

## 11. **Network Traffic**
- Patterns of network traffic.
- Detection of unusual or suspicious activity.
- Identifying potential data leaks or breaches.

---

## 12. **Compliance Issues**
- Configurations that fail to meet regulatory standards (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR).
- Improperly configured data retention or logging policies.

---

## 13. **Malware or Backdoors**
- Suspicious services or ports that may indicate malware.
- Command-and-control communication patterns.

---

## 14. **Cloud and Virtualized Environments**
- Misconfigured cloud resources (e.g., exposed S3 buckets).
- Virtual machines or containers with weak isolation or outdated software.

---

## 15. **Hidden Networks or Devices**
- Devices attempting to operate stealthily or evade detection.
- Systems with no visible traffic but active connections.

---

By identifying these elements, network scanning helps security professionals assess risks, prioritize remediation, and strengthen the overall security posture. Each discovery provides actionable insights to improve network defenses.
