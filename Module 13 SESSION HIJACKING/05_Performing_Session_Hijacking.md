# Performing Session Hijacking Using Burp Suite Professional and Ettercap

## **Disclaimer**
This guide is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of these tools for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have explicit permission from the target network or application owner.

## **1. What is Session Hijacking?**
Session hijacking is an attack where an adversary exploits a valid session of a user by stealing their session ID. This allows the attacker to impersonate the user and access their data.

---

## **2. Tools Used**
- **Burp Suite Professional**: A powerful web vulnerability scanner and testing tool.
- **Ettercap**: A comprehensive suite for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on LAN.

## **3. Steps to Perform Session Hijacking**

### **Step 1: Set Up the Environment**
1. Ensure you are in a controlled lab environment.
2. Install Burp Suite Professional and Ettercap on your machine.
3. Configure network settings for MITM capabilities (e.g., enable IP forwarding).

---

### **Step 2: Launch a MITM Attack Using Ettercap**
1. Open Ettercap and select the appropriate network interface.
2. Scan for hosts in the network:
3. Add the victim's IP and the router's IP to the target list:
4. Start ARP poisoning:
5. Start sniffing:

### **Step 3: Intercept HTTP Traffic Using Burp Suite**
1. Configure your browser to use Burp Suite as a proxy.
2. In Burp Suite:
- Go to the **Proxy** tab and ensure interception is enabled.
- Monitor HTTP requests for session cookies.
3. Identify the session cookie (e.g., `sessionid`) from the victim's HTTP requests.

---

### **Step 4: Hijack the Session**
1. Copy the victim's session cookie.
2. Open a browser or HTTP client and inject the stolen cookie:
- Use browser developer tools to modify cookies in an active session.
3. Access the victim's session as if you are the authenticated user.

---

## **4. Preventive Measures**
- Use HTTPS to encrypt traffic and prevent interception.
- Implement secure session management:
- Regenerate session IDs after login.
- Set HTTP-only and Secure flags for cookies.
- Monitor and block MITM attacks using tools like IDS/IPS.
- Educate users about secure browsing practices.

---

## **5. Conclusion**
Session hijacking demonstrates the importance of secure communication and proper session management. Always use ethical hacking practices and focus on strengthening system defenses.
