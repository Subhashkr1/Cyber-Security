Types of Steganography
Steganography can be classified based on the medium used for hiding the secret data. Here are the most common types:

1. Text-Based Steganography
Text-based steganography hides secret data within ordinary text. The hidden data could be embedded in the form of characters, words, or specific patterns in the text.

Techniques:
Whitespace or Formatting Steganography:
Hidden data is encoded in extra spaces, tabs, or line breaks that don't affect the visible content of the text.
Character Encoding:
Characters like punctuation marks or special characters may be used to encode information.
Invisible Ink:
Using invisible characters or zero-width characters (such as Zero-Width Space, Zero-Width Non-Joiner) to conceal data.
Example:
A hidden message "hello" might be represented as invisible text using the Zero-Width Space character between each letter.

2. Image-Based Steganography
Image-based steganography is one of the most popular and commonly used types, where secret data is embedded into an image file, often by manipulating the pixel values.

Techniques:
Least Significant Bit (LSB):
The least significant bit of the pixel values is modified to embed the secret message. This results in minimal changes to the image that are typically not perceptible to the human eye.
Palette-Based Techniques:
In indexed color images, the least significant bits of the color palette can be altered to hide information.
Transform Domain Techniques:
Secret data is hidden in the frequency domain of the image, such as through Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) or Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).
Example:
A hidden message "hello" could be embedded in the least significant bits of the RGB values of the pixels of a color image.

3. Audio-Based Steganography
Audio-based steganography involves hiding data within audio files. The data is embedded in the audio signal in such a way that it doesn't significantly affect the sound quality.

Techniques:
Least Significant Bit (LSB) in Audio:
Similar to images, the least significant bit of audio samples can be altered to hide data.
Echo Hiding:
An echo is added to the audio signal, and the data is embedded in the characteristics of the echo.
Phase Coding:
Data is embedded in the phase shift of the audio signal, often in inaudible frequencies.
Example:
A message like "secret" can be hidden within an audio file, such as an MP3 or WAV file, by modifying the least significant bits of the audio samples.

4. Video-Based Steganography
Video-based steganography hides secret data within video files, often leveraging both the video stream (frames) and the audio stream (if present) to embed data.

Techniques:
Frame-Based Techniques:
Data is hidden in specific frames of the video, typically by modifying the pixel values in a similar way as in image-based steganography.
Audio-Based Techniques in Video:
Audio within the video file can also be modified to hide data, similar to audio-based steganography techniques.
Motion Vector Manipulation:
Secret data can be embedded by manipulating the motion vectors (movement between video frames).
Example:
A hidden message can be inserted into a video by slightly altering the pixel data in specific frames or embedding data in the videoâ€™s audio track.

5. Network-Based Steganography
Network-based steganography involves hiding data within network traffic or communication protocols, often undetected by traditional monitoring tools.

Techniques:
Protocol Manipulation:
Data can be hidden in unused fields of network packets or in protocol headers.
Timing-Based Steganography:
Timing information, such as the delay between packets, can be altered to encode data.
Covert Channels:
Data is transmitted in the form of protocol anomalies or in channels that are normally used for other purposes (e.g., using ICMP packets to carry hidden data).
Example:
An attacker might use the unused bits in a TCP/IP packet header or manipulate the timing between packets to convey hidden messages.

6. Hardware-Based Steganography
Hardware-based steganography involves embedding secret information in physical devices or digital hardware.

Techniques:
Memory Manipulation:
Data is embedded in the memory of hardware devices such as printers, scanners, or digital cameras.
Electromagnetic Signals:
Data can be encoded in the electromagnetic emissions of devices like routers or computers.
Digital Circuits:
Data is hidden within digital circuit design, like a hidden message encoded in the timing or architecture of an embedded system.
Example:
A printer might embed a secret code in the printed output using subtle patterns that are undetectable to the naked eye.

7. DNA-Based Steganography
DNA-based steganography uses the genetic code as a medium to hide data. Information is encoded into DNA sequences and can be used for bioinformatics applications or as a novel form of hiding data.

Techniques:
Base Encoding:
A message is represented by the four nucleotides (A, T, C, G), where each nucleotide or sequence represents a portion of the message.
Modified DNA Sequences:
The encoded message is hidden by slightly altering a DNA sequence, which can be later decoded by examining the sequence.
Example:
Data like text can be encoded into a sequence of DNA, which is then synthesized into real DNA strands for storage.

8. Command-Based Steganography
Command-based steganography is used within command-line interfaces or operating system commands, where secret data is hidden in the execution of commands or in command arguments.

Techniques:
Shell Command Encoding:

Data is embedded within system commands or file names in such a way that it does not affect the execution of the command.
Shell Script:

A script may be used to hide and extract data through encoded commands.
Example:
A system administrator could hide a secret message within the arguments passed to a command, like a hidden flag or parameter, that is only interpreted correctly by specific scripts.
