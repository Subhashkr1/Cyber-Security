What is URL Masking?
URL masking is a technique used to hide the actual URL of a website by displaying a different URL in the address bar. It is commonly used for legitimate purposes such as branding and redirection, but it can also be exploited for malicious activities like phishing and fraud.

How URL Masking Works
HTML <iframe> Tag: A webpage is loaded within another page using an <iframe>, masking the actual URL.

html
Copy code
<iframe src="https://real-website.com" style="width:100%; height:100%; border:none;"></iframe>
Meta Refresh: A meta tag is used to redirect users to a different URL while keeping the original URL visible.

html
Copy code
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL=https://real-website.com">
Domain Forwarding with Masking: Some domain registrars offer "forwarding with masking," which shows a different URL in the browser while loading content from another URL.

URL Shorteners: Shortened URLs (e.g., bit.ly, tinyurl) obscure the final destination.

Legitimate Uses of URL Masking
Branding: To show a branded URL instead of a lengthy or complex URL.
Tracking: Masking for analytics or affiliate marketing links.
Redirection: Forwarding to another domain or subdomain without revealing the final destination.
Malicious Uses of URL Masking
Phishing: Masked URLs are used to mimic legitimate websites and trick users into providing sensitive information.

Example: http://paypal-secure-login.com redirects to a phishing page.
Drive-By Downloads: Masked URLs can redirect users to malicious sites that automatically download malware.

Click Fraud: Attackers use masked URLs in advertisements to generate fake traffic.

How to Detect URL Masking
Hover Over Links: Hover over the link to view the actual destination URL in the browser's status bar.

Inspect the Page Source: Check the source code for <iframe> or <meta refresh> tags.

Use Online Tools:

VirusTotal: Scans URLs for malicious content.
URLVoid: Checks for URL reputation and blacklists.
Check Certificates: Look for HTTPS and verify the SSL certificate of the website.

Disable URL Shortening: Use tools like Unshorten.It to reveal the full destination of shortened URLs.

How to Implement URL Masking Legitimately
Using an <iframe>
Create an HTML file for the masked URL.
Add the <iframe> tag to load the desired content.
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Masked Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <iframe src="https://actual-website.com" style="width:100%; height:100%; border:none;"></iframe>
</body>
</html>
