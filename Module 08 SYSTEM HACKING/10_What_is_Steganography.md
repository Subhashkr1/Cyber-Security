What is Steganography?
Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within a non-secret medium, such as an image, audio file, or video, so that the presence of the hidden data is concealed. Unlike encryption, where the message itself is scrambled and obvious, steganography focuses on obscurity to avoid detection.

Key Characteristics of Steganography
Hidden Data: Information is embedded in a way that it is not perceptible to the naked eye or ear.
Cover Medium: The medium used to hide the secret data (e.g., images, audio, text).
Payload: The secret data or message being hidden.
Stego-Medium: The resulting file after embedding the hidden message into the cover medium.
Types of Steganography
Text-Based Steganography:

Involves hiding data within text files by altering formatting, spaces, or specific characters.
Example: Using invisible characters like spaces or tabs to encode data.
Image-Based Steganography:

Hiding data within the pixel values of images, typically by altering the least significant bits (LSB).
Example: Modifying the last bit of an RGB pixel value in an image to store secret data.
Audio-Based Steganography:

Embedding data within an audio file by manipulating frequency or amplitude.
Example: LSB manipulation or phase encoding.
Video-Based Steganography:

Concealing data within video frames or audio tracks of a video file.
Example: Changing specific pixels in selected frames.
Network-Based Steganography:

Embedding data in network traffic, such as in headers, payloads, or timing patterns.
Example: Covert channels using TCP/IP packets.
How Does Steganography Work?
Encoding:
The secret message is converted into a binary format.
Binary data is embedded into the cover medium using a steganographic algorithm.
Decoding:
The stego-medium is analyzed using the same algorithm to extract the secret message.
Image-Based Steganography Example (Least Significant Bit)
Original Pixel (RGB):
makefile
Copy code
Red:   11001010
Green: 10111011
Blue:  10011101
Modify LSB to Embed Data:
Binary message: 101

Red: 11001011 (Modified)
Green: 10111010 (Modified)
Blue: 10011101 (Unchanged)
Applications of Steganography
Legitimate Uses:

Digital Watermarking: Embedding copyright information.
Secure Communication: Sending confidential data without arousing suspicion.
Malicious Uses:

Malware Delivery: Embedding malicious code within images or files.
Data Exfiltration: Hiding sensitive data in outbound traffic.
Common Tools for Steganography

How to Detect Steganography?
Steganalysis:

Process of detecting hidden data in a medium.
Common Techniques:

Visual Inspection: Examine inconsistencies in images or files.
Statistical Analysis: Check for abnormal patterns or anomalies.
Software Tools: Tools like StegExpose can detect steganographic content.
Example: Using Steghide
Hiding Data
bash
Copy code
steghide embed -cf cover.jpg -ef secret.txt -p password
-cf: Cover file (e.g., image).
-ef: File to embed.
-p: Password for encoding.
Extracting Data
bash
Copy code
steghide extract -sf cover.jpg -p password
