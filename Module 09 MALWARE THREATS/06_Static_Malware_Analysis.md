Static Malware Analysis is the process of examining malicious files or code without executing them. This method focuses on analyzing the properties, structure, and content of the malware to understand its behavior and functionality. It is often used as the first step in malware analysis because it is safer and faster than dynamic methods.

Steps in Static Malware Analysis
1. Basic File Information
Gather metadata about the malware file, such as:
File name, size, type, and hash values (MD5, SHA-256).
Compilation timestamp to determine when the file was created.
Whether the file is packed, compressed, or obfuscated.
Tools:

file: Identifies the type of file (e.g., executable, script).
md5sum/sha256sum: Computes hash values for integrity verification.
PEStudio: Analyzes PE files and provides details like imports and exports.
2. Extracting Strings
Extract readable text from the binary file to uncover:
File paths, URLs, IP addresses.
Function names or API calls.
Hardcoded credentials or suspicious commands.
Command:

bash
Copy code
strings malware_sample.exe
Tools:

Strings (Linux/Windows): Displays ASCII and Unicode text.
BinText: Extracts strings from binary files.
3. Analyzing File Headers
Examine the structure and headers of executable files (e.g., PE or ELF files) for:
Entry points, sections, and libraries used.
Indicators of malicious intent, such as unusual entry points or excessive imports.
Tools:

PE Explorer: Inspects Windows PE files.
readelf: Displays ELF file headers (Linux).
4. Identifying Imports and Exports
Analyze the APIs and functions imported/exported by the malware.
Imported functions can reveal malicious activities (e.g., CreateRemoteThread, OpenProcess).
Exported functions can indicate the presence of backdoors or trojans.
Tools:

Dependency Walker: Lists imported DLLs and functions.
CFF Explorer: Analyzes imports/exports of PE files.
5. Detecting Packing or Obfuscation
Malware authors often use packers or obfuscators to hide the code and evade detection.
Signs of packing include a single large section or unusually high entropy.
Tools:

PEiD: Detects packers and cryptors.
Detect It Easy (DIE): Identifies packing and compression methods.
6. Signature-Based Detection
Compare the malware file against a database of known malware signatures.
Signatures are hash values or patterns unique to specific malware.
Tools:

YARA: Creates and matches rules for identifying malware patterns.
VirusTotal: Online platform for scanning files against multiple antivirus engines.
7. Examining Code with Disassemblers
Use a disassembler to translate machine code into human-readable assembly code for:
Detecting malicious functions or algorithms (e.g., encryption, process injection).
Identifying hardcoded data and suspicious instructions.
Tools:

IDA Pro: Industry-standard disassembler.
Ghidra: Open-source reverse engineering tool.
8. Extracting Embedded Data
Analyze embedded resources, such as:
Icons, images, or text files.
Malware configurations or secondary payloads.
Tools:

Resource Hacker: Extracts resources from PE files.
binwalk: Locates and extracts embedded files from binaries.
Advantages of Static Malware Analysis
Safe: No risk of executing malicious code.
Quick: Ideal for detecting known malware or identifying basic properties.
Low Resource Requirement: Does not require complex setups like sandboxes.
Limitations of Static Malware Analysis
Limited Insight: Cannot reveal runtime behavior or system interactions.
Evasion Techniques: Ineffective against heavily obfuscated or packed malware.
Skill Requirement: Advanced analysis requires familiarity with assembly code and malware structures.
Workflow Example
Start with basic file analysis to gather metadata.
Use string extraction to find readable text.
Inspect file headers and imports/exports for suspicious characteristics.
Detect packing or obfuscation using entropy analysis tools.
If needed, disassemble the file for a deeper investigation.
