Dynamic Malware Analysis involves executing malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior in real-time. This method helps understand the malware's runtime characteristics, including how it interacts with the file system, network, and operating system.

Steps in Dynamic Malware Analysis
1. Prepare a Controlled Environment
Dynamic analysis must be conducted in a secure, isolated environment to prevent the malware from escaping and infecting other systems.

Components of the Environment:
Virtual Machines (VMs):
Tools: VMware, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V.
Use snapshots to revert the system to a clean state after analysis.
Sandboxing Tools:
Automated platforms like Cuckoo Sandbox or Any.Run.
Network Isolation:
Use virtual networks or a closed LAN to prevent the malware from accessing the internet.
2. Monitor File and System Changes
Observe how the malware interacts with files, directories, and the registry.

Activities to Monitor:
File creation, modification, or deletion.
Registry keys being added, modified, or deleted.
Creation of hidden files or directories.
Tools:
Process Monitor (ProcMon): Tracks real-time system changes.
Regshot: Captures and compares registry snapshots.
3. Analyze Process Behavior
Monitor the processes created or manipulated by the malware.

Key Indicators:
Process injection or creation of suspicious child processes.
High CPU or memory usage by unknown processes.
Attempts to disable security software.
Tools:
Process Explorer: Tracks running processes and their properties.
Process Hacker: Advanced process management tool.
4. Observe Network Activity
Check for any network communication initiated by the malware.

Key Indicators:
DNS queries to suspicious domains.
Connections to known command-and-control (C2) servers.
Data exfiltration attempts or unusual traffic patterns.
Tools:
Wireshark: Captures and analyzes network packets.
Fakenet-NG: Simulates a network to capture malicious traffic.
5. Inspect Memory
Analyze the systemâ€™s memory for malicious activity, such as:

Injected code in legitimate processes.
Malicious payloads loaded in memory.
Tools:
Volatility Framework: Extracts and analyzes memory dumps.
RAM Capturer: Captures live memory for analysis.
6. Identify Anti-Analysis Techniques
Some malware attempts to detect if it is running in a sandbox or virtual environment. Common techniques include:

Checking for virtual machine artifacts.
Delaying execution to avoid detection.
Detecting debugging tools.
Mitigation:
Use anti-anti-analysis tools to hide VM artifacts.
Use tools like Scdbg to step through delayed code execution.
7. Capture and Log Events
Record all events during execution for detailed analysis.

Logs to Collect:
System event logs (Windows Event Viewer).
Network logs (Wireshark or Fakenet-NG captures).
Malware behavior logs (Cuckoo Sandbox or ProcMon outputs).
Tools for Dynamic Malware Analysis
1. Automated Sandboxing
Cuckoo Sandbox: Open-source malware analysis system.
Any.Run: Interactive online malware sandbox.
2. Process Monitoring
ProcMon: Tracks file system, registry, and process activities.
Sysmon: Advanced system monitoring tool.
3. Network Analysis
Wireshark: Analyzes network traffic and identifies anomalies.
TCPView: Displays active TCP/UDP connections.
4. Memory Analysis
Volatility: Framework for analyzing memory dumps.
LiME (Linux Memory Extractor): Extracts memory for Linux systems.
Advantages of Dynamic Malware Analysis
Detailed Insights: Provides runtime behaviors, such as API calls, file creation, and network communication.
Detection of Anti-Static Techniques: Reveals activities hidden during static analysis, like runtime unpacking.
Real-Time Observation: Captures immediate impact on systems and networks.
Limitations of Dynamic Malware Analysis
Risk of Infection: Improper isolation can lead to system or network compromise.
Resource Intensive: Requires significant computational and network resources.
Limited Visibility: Some behaviors (e.g., time-delayed actions) may not manifest during the observation period.
Workflow Example
Set Up the Environment:

Create an isolated VM or use a sandbox.
Ensure network traffic is logged or redirected to controlled servers.
Execute the Malware:

Launch the malware in the controlled environment.
Monitor Activities:

Record system changes, process creation, and network traffic.
Capture Logs:

Save logs and memory dumps for further analysis.
Analyze and Report:

Use the collected data to understand the malware's objectives and methods.
Common Use Cases
Investigating malware's impact on systems and networks.
Understanding C2 communication protocols.
Developing detection and mitigation strategies.
