Malware analysis is the process of examining malicious software to understand its behavior, purpose, and impact on infected systems. This process helps cybersecurity professionals detect, mitigate, and protect against malware threats. Malware analysis can be categorized into four main types based on the techniques and depth of investigation.

1. Static Analysis (Code Analysis)
This approach involves analyzing the malware's code or binaries without executing it.

Key Characteristics:
Focuses on file properties, code structure, and embedded data.
Uses tools like disassemblers, decompilers, and hex editors.
Involves techniques like hashing and checking for signatures in known malware databases.
Advantages:
Safe, as it does not execute the malware.
Quick to detect known threats using signature-based methods.
Limitations:
Ineffective against obfuscated or encrypted malware.
Cannot reveal runtime behavior.
Common Tools:
Strings: Extracts readable text from binary files.
IDA Pro: A powerful disassembler.
PEiD: Identifies packers or cryptors in Windows executables.
2. Dynamic Analysis (Behavioral Analysis)
Dynamic analysis involves executing the malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior in real-time.

Key Characteristics:
Focuses on runtime behavior, such as file changes, network activity, and registry modifications.
Conducted in a sandbox or virtual machine to isolate the malware.
Advantages:
Provides detailed insights into malware behavior and its impact on the system.
Effective against obfuscated or polymorphic malware.
Limitations:
Requires a secure and isolated environment to prevent accidental infection.
May not reveal all behaviors if the malware uses anti-analysis techniques.
Common Tools:
Cuckoo Sandbox: Open-source automated malware analysis platform.
Process Monitor (ProcMon): Monitors file system, registry, and process activities.
Wireshark: Captures and analyzes network traffic.
3. Hybrid Analysis
Hybrid analysis combines static and dynamic techniques to leverage the strengths of both approaches.

Key Characteristics:
Involves initial static analysis for a quick overview and signature matching.
Follows up with dynamic analysis to observe runtime behaviors.
Advantages:
Comprehensive understanding of malware characteristics.
Balances safety and depth of analysis.
Limitations:
More time-consuming than using a single approach.
Requires expertise in both static and dynamic analysis techniques.
Common Tools:
Hybrid Analysis Platform: Online platform for automated malware analysis.
Joe Sandbox: Supports in-depth static and dynamic analysis.
4. Manual Code Analysis (Reverse Engineering)
This is an in-depth examination of the malware's code, often performed by skilled reverse engineers.

Key Characteristics:
Involves manually examining assembly code or source code (if available).
Aimed at understanding complex malware functionality, such as encryption methods or evasion techniques.
Advantages:
Provides the most detailed insights into malware capabilities.
Can uncover hidden functionalities and vulnerabilities.
Limitations:
Time-intensive and requires advanced expertise.
Inefficient for large-scale or time-sensitive threats.
Common Tools:
Ghidra: A reverse engineering framework developed by the NSA.
OllyDbg: A popular debugger for Windows binaries.
Radare2: Open-source reverse engineering tool.
Comparison Table
Type	Focus	Tools Used	Pros	Cons
Static Analysis	Code or binary files	IDA Pro, Strings	Safe, quick for known malware	Ineffective for obfuscation
Dynamic Analysis	Runtime behavior	Cuckoo Sandbox, ProcMon	Detailed runtime insights	Risky without proper isolation
