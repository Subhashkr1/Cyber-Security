Viruses and Worms are two common types of malware, each with distinct characteristics and methods of operation. Both can cause significant harm to systems, but their behaviors and mechanisms of spreading differ.

What is a Virus?
A virus is a type of malware that attaches itself to a legitimate file or program. It requires human action, such as opening an infected file or running an infected program, to activate and spread.

Key Characteristics of a Virus:
Dependency on Host
It attaches to files, documents, or programs and spreads when the host is executed or shared.
Propagation
Spreads through infected files, removable media (e.g., USB drives), or downloads.
Damage
Can corrupt, delete, or modify data, disrupt system operations, or spread to other systems.
Examples of Computer Viruses:
ILOVEYOU Virus: Spread via email attachments, causing widespread data destruction.
Melissa Virus: Spread through Word documents and email, disrupting email servers.
CIH (Chernobyl): Overwrote system data and rendered hardware unusable.
What is a Worm?
A worm is a standalone malware program that replicates itself to spread to other devices or networks. Unlike a virus, a worm does not need a host file or user action to propagate.

Key Characteristics of a Worm:
Standalone Operation
Worms are self-contained and do not attach to other files or programs.
Network-Based Spread
Exploits network vulnerabilities to move across systems automatically.
Damage
Overloads networks, consumes system resources, and can deliver malicious payloads.
Examples of Computer Worms:
Morris Worm: The first widely recognized worm, which slowed down the early internet in 1988.
Blaster Worm: Exploited Windows vulnerabilities to crash systems and spread automatically.
Conficker Worm: Infected millions of systems by exploiting a Windows vulnerability in 2008.
Differences Between Viruses and Worms
Feature	Virus	Worm
Dependency	Requires a host file or program to attach to.	Operates independently, without a host file.
Propagation	Requires user action (e.g., running an infected file).	Spreads automatically via networks.
Primary Impact	Corrupts or alters files, causes system instability.	Consumes bandwidth, spreads rapidly.
Spreading Method	File-sharing, email attachments, removable media.	Exploits vulnerabilities in networks/systems.
Similarities Between Viruses and Worms
Both can cause significant harm to systems and networks.
Both are malicious programs used by attackers for unauthorized purposes.
Both can be delivered through phishing, downloads, or compromised systems.
Prevention Tips for Viruses and Worms
Install Reliable Antivirus Software

Protects against viruses and some worms.
Keep Systems Updated

Patch operating systems and applications regularly to fix vulnerabilities.
Be Cautious with Emails

Avoid clicking on suspicious links or opening unknown attachments.
Use Firewalls

Helps block worms from spreading through networks.
Educate Users

Awareness about malicious threats reduces risky behaviors.
