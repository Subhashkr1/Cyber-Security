Here are some notable examples of malware, along with brief descriptions of their impact:

1. WannaCry (Ransomware)
What it does: Encrypts files on infected systems and demands a ransom in Bitcoin for decryption.
Impact: In 2017, WannaCry spread globally, exploiting a Windows vulnerability called EternalBlue. It affected over 200,000 systems in 150+ countries, including healthcare services (e.g., the UKâ€™s NHS), causing significant operational disruptions.
How it spread: It used a worm-like propagation method across networks.
2. Stuxnet (Worm)
What it does: Specifically targets industrial control systems (ICS), such as SCADA systems, to sabotage operations.
Impact: Discovered in 2010, Stuxnet is believed to have been used to disrupt Iran's nuclear program by causing centrifuges to malfunction.
How it spread: Via USB drives and infected computers connected to the targeted systems.
3. Zeus (Trojan)
What it does: A banking Trojan that steals sensitive information such as login credentials and financial data.
Impact: Active between 2007 and 2010, it infected millions of systems and caused billions of dollars in losses.
How it spread: Through phishing emails and malicious websites.
4. Mirai (Botnet)
What it does: Infects Internet of Things (IoT) devices and uses them to launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
Impact: In 2016, the Mirai botnet caused significant internet outages by targeting Dyn, a major DNS provider, affecting platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and Netflix.
How it spread: Exploited default credentials of IoT devices.
5. Emotet (Trojan)
What it does: Initially a banking Trojan, it evolved into a malware delivery service, spreading ransomware and other malicious payloads.
Impact: It caused widespread infections globally before being disrupted by a coordinated international operation in 2021.
How it spread: Through phishing emails containing malicious links or attachments.
6. NotPetya (Ransomware/Wiper)
What it does: Encrypts the master boot record, making systems unusable. It posed as ransomware but primarily acted as a data wiper.
Impact: In 2017, it caused massive financial and operational damage, particularly to businesses in Ukraine, and spread to global organizations.
How it spread: Via a compromised update mechanism of the accounting software MEDoc.
7. Cryptolocker (Ransomware)
What it does: Encrypts files and demands ransom payments for decryption.
Impact: Affected hundreds of thousands of computers between 2013 and 2014, targeting businesses and individuals.
How it spread: Through malicious email attachments.
8. Pegasus (Spyware)
What it does: Highly sophisticated spyware that targets mobile devices, enabling attackers to access calls, messages, emails, and even camera/microphone feeds.
Impact: Allegedly developed by NSO Group, it has been used to target journalists, activists, and politicians.
How it spread: Exploits zero-day vulnerabilities to install without user interaction.
9. Blaster Worm (Worm)
What it does: Exploits vulnerabilities in Windows systems to crash systems and spread to other devices.
Impact: In 2003, it caused significant disruptions by rebooting systems repeatedly.
How it spread: Exploited a vulnerability in Windows RPC service.
10. CIH (Chernobyl Virus)
What it does: Corrupts data on hard drives and can overwrite the system BIOS, rendering the computer unusable.
Impact: In 1998, it caused extensive damage to millions of computers.
How it spread: Through infected executables and pirated software.
