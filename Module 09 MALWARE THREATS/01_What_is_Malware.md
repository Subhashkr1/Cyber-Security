Malware, short for malicious software, is a general term used to describe any software designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise devices, networks, or data. Malware is typically created with malicious intent and is used by attackers to disrupt operations, steal sensitive information, gain unauthorized access to systems, or cause other forms of damage. It can take many forms and serve a variety of purposes.

Common Types of Malware
Viruses

Self-replicating programs that attach themselves to legitimate files or programs.
Spread through file-sharing, downloads, or email attachments.
Worms

Standalone malware that replicates itself to spread across networks.
Can cause widespread damage by consuming bandwidth or exploiting vulnerabilities.
Trojan Horses

Disguised as legitimate software but perform malicious activities once executed.
Often used to create backdoors for unauthorized access.
Ransomware

Encrypts data on a victim's system, demanding payment (often in cryptocurrency) for decryption.
Examples: WannaCry, NotPetya.
Spyware

Secretly gathers user information without consent.
Often used to steal sensitive data like passwords or financial information.
Adware

Displays unwanted advertisements and may track user behavior.
Often bundled with free software.
Rootkits

Provide privileged access to a system while hiding their presence.
Difficult to detect and remove.
Keyloggers

Record keystrokes to capture sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.
Botnets

Networks of infected devices (bots) controlled remotely by attackers.
Used for large-scale attacks like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).
Fileless Malware

Operates in memory and does not leave traces on the disk.
Harder to detect with traditional antivirus tools.
How Malware Spreads
Phishing Emails: Attachments or links that contain malware.
Malicious Websites: Exploit vulnerabilities in browsers or plugins.
Software Downloads: Includes pirated software or fake apps.
Removable Media: USB drives or external hard drives infected with malware.
Network Vulnerabilities: Exploiting unpatched systems or insecure configurations.
Signs of Malware Infection
Slow system performance.
Frequent crashes or freezes.
Unauthorized pop-ups or ads.
Unusual network activity.
Programs opening or closing without user input.
Files disappearing or being encrypted unexpectedly.
Preventing Malware Infections
Use reliable antivirus and antimalware software.
Keep software, operating systems, and devices updated.
Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.
Use strong, unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication.
Regularly back up data to secure locations.
