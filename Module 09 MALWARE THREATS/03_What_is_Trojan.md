A Trojan, short for Trojan Horse, is a type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate or harmless software to trick users into installing or executing it. Once activated, a Trojan performs malicious activities without the user's consent or knowledge. Unlike viruses or worms, Trojans do not self-replicate; instead, they rely on user action or social engineering tactics for distribution.

How Trojans Work
Disguise: Trojans are often embedded in seemingly useful software, attachments, or files (e.g., games, updates, or email attachments).
Delivery: They are distributed via phishing emails, malicious websites, software downloads, or fake apps.
Activation: Once the user downloads and runs the Trojan, it executes its malicious payload.
Damage: The Trojan performs various harmful actions, such as stealing data, creating backdoors, or disrupting system operations.
