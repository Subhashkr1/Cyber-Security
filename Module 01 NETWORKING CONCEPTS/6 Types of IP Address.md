- **Purpose:** Used for devices that need a constant address, such as servers, printers, or network equipment.
- **Advantages:**
  - Reliable for hosting websites or services as the address remains constant.
  - Easier to set up remote access and management.
- **Example:** 192.168.1.10

### 2. Dynamic IP Address

- **Description:** A dynamic IP address is assigned by a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server and may change periodically.
- **Purpose:** Used for most devices on home and office networks, providing IP addresses from a pool.
- **Advantages:**
  - Reduces the need for manual configuration of IP addresses.
  - Efficient use of IP address space by reusing addresses.
- **Example:** 192.168.1.25 (may change over time)

### 3. Public IP Address

- **Advantages:**
  - Enhances security by keeping internal addresses hidden from the public internet.
  - Allows multiple devices within a network to share a single public IP address via NAT.
- **Example:** 192.168.0.10

### 5. Loopback IP Address

- **Description:** A loopback IP address is used for testing and communication within the same device.
- **Purpose:** Allows a device to communicate with itself.
- **Advantages:**
  - Useful for testing network applications and configurations.
  - Commonly used IP address is 127.0.0.1.
- **Example:** 127.0.0.1
