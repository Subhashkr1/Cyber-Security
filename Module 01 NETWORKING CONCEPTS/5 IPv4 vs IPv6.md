# IPv4 vs IPv6

## English Version

**IPv4** (Internet Protocol version 4) and **IPv6** (Internet Protocol version 6) are two versions of the Internet Protocol used to identify devices on a network. They have different structures and capabilities.

### IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

- **Format:** IPv4 addresses are written as four decimal numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **Address Space:** IPv4 provides approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.
- **Address Example:** 192.168.0.1
- **Features:**
  - Limited address space due to the 32-bit address size.
  - Commonly used for most networks today.
  - Includes features like NAT (Network Address Translation) to cope with address shortages.
  
### IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)

- **Format:** IPv6 addresses are written as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- **Address Space:** IPv6 provides an almost unlimited address space, with approximately 340 undecillion unique addresses.
- **Address Example:** 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
- **Features:**
  - Vastly larger address space due to the 128-bit address size.
  - Simplified header structure and improved routing efficiency.
  - Built-in security features like IPsec (Internet Protocol Security).
  - No need for NAT as the address space is sufficient to accommodate all devices.

### Key Differences

- **Address Length:** IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, while IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long.
- **Address Space:** IPv4 has about 4.3 billion addresses, whereas IPv6 has a virtually unlimited number.
- **Configuration:** IPv6 supports automatic address configuration (stateless address autoconfiguration), which simplifies network management.
- **Security:** IPv6 has better built-in security features compared to IPv4.

## Hinglish Version

**IPv4** (Internet Protocol version 4) aur **IPv6** (Internet Protocol version 6) do versions hain Internet Protocol ke jo network pe devices ko identify karne ke liye use hote hain. Inke structures aur capabilities alag hain.

### IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)

- **Format:** IPv4 addresses ko four decimal numbers ke roop me likha jata hai jo periods se separated hote hain (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
- **Address Space:** IPv4 lagbhag 4.3 billion unique addresses provide karta hai.
- **Address Example:** 192.168.0.1
- **Features:**
  - 32-bit address size ki wajah se limited address space.
  - Aaj ke networks me commonly use hota hai.
  - Address shortages cope karne ke liye NAT (Network Address Translation) jaise features include karta hai.

### IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)

- **Format:** IPv6 addresses ko eight groups of four hexadecimal digits ke roop me likha jata hai jo colons se separated hote hain (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
- **Address Space:** IPv6 virtually unlimited address space provide karta hai, lagbhag 340 undecillion unique addresses ke saath.
- **Address Example:** 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
- **Features:**
  - 128-bit address size ki wajah se vastly larger address space.
  - Simplified header structure aur improved routing efficiency.
  - Built-in security features jaise IPsec (Internet Protocol Security).
  - NAT ki zaroorat nahi, kyunki address space sufficient hai sab devices ko accommodate karne ke liye.

### Key Differences

- **Address Length:** IPv4 addresses 32 bits long hote hain, jabki IPv6 addresses 128 bits long hote hain.
- **Address Space:** IPv4 ke paas lagbhag 4.3 billion addresses hain, jabki IPv6 ke paas practically unlimited number of addresses hain.
- **Configuration:** IPv6 automatic address configuration (stateless address autoconfiguration) support karta hai, jo network management ko simplify karta hai.
- **Security:** IPv6 ke paas IPv4 ke comparison me behtar built-in security features hain.
