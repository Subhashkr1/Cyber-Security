# **Types of Wireless Threats**

Wireless networks are inherently more vulnerable to attacks due to their open and broadcast nature. Understanding the various types of wireless threats is essential for securing networks against unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious activities.

---

## **1. Eavesdropping**
- **Description:** 
  - Attackers intercept and listen to data transmitted over a wireless network.
- **How It Works:**
  - Exploits unencrypted or poorly encrypted networks.
  - Tools like packet sniffers (e.g., Wireshark) capture network traffic.
- **Impact:** 
  - Sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or emails can be stolen.
- **Prevention:**
  - Use WPA3 encryption and VPNs to secure communications.

---

## **2. Unauthorized Access**
- **Description:**
  - Attackers connect to a wireless network without permission.
- **How It Works:**
  - Exploits weak or default passwords.
- **Impact:**
  - Network resources are consumed, and sensitive data can be accessed.
- **Prevention:**
  - Use strong passwords and enable MAC address filtering.

---

## **3. Rogue Access Points**
- **Description:**
  - Malicious access points set up to mimic legitimate networks.
- **How It Works:**
  - Users unknowingly connect to the rogue AP, giving attackers access to their data.
- **Impact:**
  - Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and data theft.
- **Prevention:**
  - Regularly scan for unauthorized APs and disable SSID broadcasting.

## **4. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**
- **Description:**
  - Attackers intercept and alter communication between two parties.
- **How It Works:**
  - Typically involves a rogue AP or DNS spoofing.
- **Impact:**
  - Data tampering, phishing, or credential theft.
- **Prevention:**
  - Use HTTPS for web browsing and encrypt wireless traffic.

---

## **5. Denial of Service (DoS)**
- **Description:**
  - Overloading a wireless network with fake requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
- **How It Works:**
  - Attackers flood the network with traffic or send deauthentication packets.
- **Impact:**
  - Network downtime and disrupted services.
- **Prevention:**
  - Use intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).

---

## **6. War Driving**
- **Description:**
  - Attackers search for open or poorly secured wireless networks while driving or walking around.
- **How It Works:**
  - Tools like Kismet or NetStumbler are used to locate networks.
- **Impact:**
  - Identifying vulnerable networks for future attacks.
- **Prevention:**
  - Use strong encryption and disable SSID broadcasting.

---

## **7. Evil Twin Attacks**
- **Description:**
  - A fake wireless network set up to lure users into connecting.
- **How It Works:**
  - Attackers mimic the SSID of a legitimate network.
- **Impact:**
  - Data theft and malware distribution.
- **Prevention:**
  - Verify SSIDs before connecting and use VPNs for secure browsing.

---

## **8. Bluetooth Attacks**
- **Description:**
  - Exploits vulnerabilities in Bluetooth-enabled devices.
- **Types:**
  - **Bluejacking:** Sending unsolicited messages to devices.
  - **Bluesnarfing:** Accessing sensitive data without authorization.
  - **Bluebugging:** Taking control of a device remotely.
- **Prevention:**
  - Disable Bluetooth when not in use and avoid pairing with unknown devices.

---

## **9. Packet Injection**
- **Description:**
  - Malicious packets are injected into a wireless network to disrupt communication.
- **How It Works:**
  - Tools like Aircrack-ng are used to inject fake packets.
- **Impact:**
  - Loss of data integrity and disruption of network services.
- **Prevention:**
  - Use encrypted protocols and monitor network traffic.

---

## **10. Wi-Fi Phishing**
- **Description:**
  - Setting up a fake captive portal to steal credentials.
- **How It Works:**
  - Users are redirected to a malicious login page when connecting to the network.
- **Impact:**
  - Credential theft and unauthorized access.
- **Prevention:**
  - Avoid entering sensitive information on untrusted networks.

---

## **11. Signal Jamming**
- **Description:**
  - Attackers disrupt wireless communication by overpowering the signal with noise.
- **How It Works:**
  - High-power transmitters are used to create interference.
- **Impact:**
  - Network downtime and loss of connectivity.
- **Prevention:**
  - Use frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) or directional antennas.

---

## **12. Replay Attacks**
- **Description:**
  - Captured packets are resent to trick the network into unauthorized actions.
- **How It Works:**
  - Exploits the lack of proper session validation.
- **Impact:**
  - Unauthorized access or repeated execution of harmful commands.
- **Prevention:**
  - Use encrypted protocols with unique session tokens.

---

## **Conclusion**
Wireless networks are susceptible to a wide range of threats due to their open nature. Implementing robust security measures such as strong encryption, network monitoring, and regular updates can significantly reduce the risk of attacks. Understanding these threats and adopting proactive security practices is essential for safeguarding wireless communications.
