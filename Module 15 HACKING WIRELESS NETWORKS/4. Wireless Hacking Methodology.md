# **Wireless Hacking Methodology**

Wireless hacking involves identifying vulnerabilities in wireless networks and exploiting them to gain unauthorized access or compromise network integrity. Ethical hackers and penetration testers often follow a systematic methodology to assess the security of wireless networks.

## **1. Wireless Reconnaissance**
The first step in wireless hacking is gathering information about available networks and their configurations.

### Techniques:
- **War Driving:**
  - Using tools to detect wireless networks while moving through an area.
- **SSID Discovery:**
  - Identifying network names, hidden SSIDs, and their associated MAC addresses.
- **Signal Analysis:**
  - Measuring signal strength to locate access points.

### Tools:
- Kismet
- NetStumbler
- Airodump-ng

---

## **2. Wireless Network Scanning**
Once networks are identified, scanning provides detailed information about their security settings.

### Activities:
- Identifying encryption protocols (WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3).
- Detecting open networks or those using weak passwords.
- Mapping connected devices.

### Tools:
- Wireshark
- Fing
- Acrylic Wi-Fi Analyzer

---

## **3. Vulnerability Identification**
Analyzing the wireless network for exploitable weaknesses.

### Focus Areas:
- Weak encryption protocols (e.g., WEP, WPA with TKIP).
- Misconfigured access points.
- Default credentials or weak passwords.

### Tools:
- Aircrack-ng
- Nessus
- Acunetix

---

## **4. Exploitation**
Exploiting identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or disrupt network functionality.

### Techniques:
1. **WEP Cracking:**
   - Exploiting weak initialization vectors (IVs) to recover encryption keys.
   - Tool: Aircrack-ng.
2. **WPA/WPA2 Cracking:**
   - Performing dictionary or brute force attacks on pre-shared keys.
   - Tool: Hashcat, Cowpatty.
3. **Rogue Access Point:**
   - Creating a fake access point to capture user credentials.
   - Tool: Airbase-ng.
4. **Evil Twin Attack:**
   - Mimicking a legitimate network to intercept traffic.
   - Tool: Wifiphisher.
5. **Deauthentication Attack:**
   - Forcing devices to disconnect from the network.
   - Tool: Aireplay-ng.

---

## **5. Post-Exploitation**
After gaining access, hackers may further exploit the network or connected devices.

### Activities:
- Capturing sensitive data (e.g., login credentials, emails, files).
- Monitoring and logging user activity.
- Planting malware or backdoors.
- Creating persistent access.

### Tools:
- Ettercap
- Responder
- Metasploit

---

## **6. Covering Tracks**
To avoid detection, attackers often take steps to hide their presence.

### Techniques:
- Deleting log files.
- Spoofing MAC addresses to conceal the attacker's identity.
- Using encryption to mask malicious traffic.

### Tools:
- MAC Changer
- TOR

---

## **7. Reporting (For Ethical Hackers)**
In ethical hacking or penetration testing, reporting is the final step.

### Components:
- Documenting identified vulnerabilities and their impact.
- Providing recommendations for mitigation.
- Sharing logs and screenshots for evidence.

### Tools:
- Dradis
- Microsoft Word/Excel for reporting.

## **Common Wireless Hacking Tools**
- **Aircrack-ng Suite:** For WEP/WPA cracking and network monitoring.
- **Wireshark:** For capturing and analyzing network traffic.
- **Reaver:** For exploiting WPS vulnerabilities.
- **Wifiphisher:** For phishing attacks.
- **Kismet:** For network discovery and analysis.
- **Hashcat:** For password cracking.

---

## **Countermeasures**
1. **Use Strong Encryption:**
   - Employ WPA3 or WPA2 with AES encryption.
2. **Disable WPS:**
   - Vulnerable to brute force attacks.
3. **Strong Passwords:**
   - Use long, complex passwords.
4. **Enable Network Monitoring:**
   - Detect and respond to suspicious activity.
5. **Regular Firmware Updates:**
   - Protect against known vulnerabilities.
6. **MAC Address Filtering:**
   - Restrict devices that can connect to the network.

Wireless hacking methodology helps identify potential risks in wireless networks. While attackers exploit these techniques for malicious purposes, ethical hackers use them to improve network security and protect users from threats.
